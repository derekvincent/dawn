Not to say we’re unruly about service, or value, or quality, but unruly<br\/>about design. Unruly Design. Social adventure (and occasionally misadventure) through<br\/>art and manufacture. <\/p><p>We follow our passion in all the things we<br\/>do, and all the relationships we have, with manufacturers, with artisans, with<br\/>the very objects and mediums with which we work. We source, co-design and<br\/>design pieces that are highly individual while catering to the form and<br\/>function of modern lifestyles and spaces. An uncompromising dedication to<br\/>quality and service combined with a very unique range makes Unruly.Design a preferred<br\/>destination for discerning (collectors, buyers?) across North America and<br\/>beyond.<\/p><p>We are a <em>for<\/em>-profit, we need to make some excess revenue to keep funding the<br\/>exploration, and of course if we won lotto we wouldn’t turn it down, in fact<br\/>we’d probably get quite – well, <em>unruly<\/em>,<br\/>for a bit, but then we’d be back at it - creating, curating, unearthing more uber<br\/>cool “stuff”.
